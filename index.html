                        <h2>Basic Fitness</h2>
                        <p>Basic Fitness is defined as the Pushups are one of the most basic, yet effective, body weight
                            moves you can perform because of the number of muscles that are recruited to perform them.
                            Start in a plank position. Your core should be tight, shoulders pulled down and back, and
                            your neck neutral. Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more
                            specifically, the ability to perform aspects of sports, occupations and daily activities.
                            Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper nutrition, moderate-vigorous physical
                            exercise, and sufficient rest. Fitness is defined as the quality or state of being fit and
                            healthy. Before the industrial revolution, fitness was defined as the capacity to carry out
                            the day’s activities without undue fatigue.

                        <h2>Body Building</h2>
                        <p> Body Building is about just that: building your body. Bodybuilding is the use of progressive
                            resistance exercise to control and develop one's musculature (muscle building) by muscle
                            hypertrophy for aesthetic purposes. It is distinct from similar activities such as
                            powerlifting because it focuses on physical appearance instead of strength. An individual
                            who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder. In professional bodybuilding,
                            competitors appear in lineups and perform specified poses (and later individual posing
                            routines) for a panel of judges who rank them based on symmetry, muscularity, size,
                            conditioning, posing, and stage presentation.

                        <h2>Yoga Training</h2>
                        <p>Yoga Training as exercise is a physical activity consisting mainly of postures, often
                            connected by flowing sequences, sometimes accompanied by breathing exercises, and frequently
                            ending with relaxation lying down or meditation. Yoga in this form has become familiar
                            across the world, especially in America and Europe. It is derived from the postures used in
                            the medieval spiritual discipline of Haṭha yoga, but it is generally simply called "yoga".
                            Academics have given yoga as exercise a variety of names, including modern postural yoga and
                            transnational anglophone yoga. Postures were not central in any of the older traditions of
                            yoga; posture practice was revived in the 1920s by yoga gurus including Yogendra and
                            Kuvalayananda, who emphasised its health benefits.
